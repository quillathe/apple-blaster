# apple-blaster
Rando apple/unix/bash scripts and tasks I'm working on

Collection of things I'm fiddling with.  Mostly tasks and sequences I use to stage and maintain apple systems in education.

#xcode-ssl.sh

Installs X-Code from Apple.  Then installs Cert Authority so you can actually do stuff over OpenSSL.  Run as root or package and roll with Munki etc.
